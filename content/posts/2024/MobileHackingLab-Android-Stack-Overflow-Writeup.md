# Android Stack Overflow Exploitation (ARMv7) - MobileHackingLab

In this post, I will be walking through the solution to an Android Stack Overflow vulnerability while keeping security mechanisms enabled. The twist? I wonâ€™t be using Frida to bypass protections this time! ðŸ˜‰

Let's dive right in and break things down step by step.

</p>

## Initial Setup and Analysis

Iâ€™ve downloaded the target application and begun my analysis by reviewing the Java code. Since weâ€™re dealing with ARM architecture, our approach will focus on analyzing and exploiting the vulnerability within that context.

### Setting Up the AVD (Android Virtual Device)

To start, I installed and ran the app on a **Pixel 3a** device using **API 25** on **Android Studio's AVD**. This setup will allow us to simulate and observe the app's behavior in a controlled environment.

Let's see how the app looks and functions within this AVD before we dive deeper into the vulnerability analysis.

## Application Overview

It appears that the application is a **Server/Client Chat Messaging Application** running on **port 6000**, as indicated by the line:

```Java
public static final int SERVERPORT = 6000;
```

The app also loads a native binary library called **"native-lib"**, which contains three interesting functions:

* `leakMemory()`
* `overFlow()`
* `stringFromJNI()`

These functions are defined in the following snippet:

```Java
public native String leakMemory(byte[] bArr);

public native void overFlow(byte[] bArr, int i);

public native String stringFromJNI();

static {
    System.loadLibrary("native-lib");
}
```

## Vulnerabilities in Native Functions

Upon further inspection, we can see that the `memoryLeak()` function is vulnerable to a **Format String vulnerability**, while the `overFlow()` function leverages the `cp()` function, which is vulnerable to a **Stack Buffer Overflow**.

Hereâ€™s the vulnerable `cp()` function:

```c
/* cp(char const*, int) */
void cp(char *param_1, int param_2) {
  undefined auStack_d8[200];
  int local_10;
  char *local_c;

  local_10 = param_2;
  local_c = param_1;
  __aeabi_memclr(auStack_d8, 200);
  
  if (0 < local_10) {
    __aeabi_memcpy(auStack_d8, local_c, local_10);
  }
  return;
}
```

The buffer `auStack_d8` has a fixed size of 200 bytes, and the function copies data into it without sufficient boundary checks, making it vulnerable to Stack Buffer Overflow when `param_2` exceeds the buffer size.

## Analyzing Behavior with Frida

To better understand the behavior, we can connect to **port 6000**, send some crafted data, and observe how the application responds. While doing this, I used **Frida** to trace which functions are called and in what order.

### Steps to Run the Application and Attach Frida

First, launch the application via ADB:

```sh
adb shell am start -n com.example.mynativetest/.MainActivity
```

Next, execute the Frida server on the target device:

```sh
/data/local/tmp/frida-server-16.4.10-android-arm
```

Finally, attach to the application using **Frida-Trace** to monitor native function calls:

```sh
frida-trace -U -i "Java_*" mynativetest
```

At this point, we can start sending data to the server on port 6000 and monitor how the vulnerable functions (`memoryLeak()` and `cp()`) behave in real-time.

With **Frida-Trace** now ready to instrument the called functions, the next step is to connect to the server on **port 6000**. To make things easier for local analysis, I performed a little trick by using **ADB port forwarding** to map the server's port to my localhost.

Hereâ€™s the command to forward **port 6000** from the device to localhost:

```sh
adb forward tcp:6000 tcp:6000
```

By doing this, we can interact with the application locally as if it were running on the same machine, allowing us to send and receive data directly through `localhost:6000`.
