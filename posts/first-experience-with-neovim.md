## My First Experience with Neovim

I'm a Vim user but, I love to try new things and this time, I tried Neovim.
Installation is so easy, I'm an Arch Linux user so it is easy as use

`sudo pacman -S neovim` command.

You can check the [Neovim Github](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) for installation steps.

When it is completed, you can run Neovim by `nvim` command.
