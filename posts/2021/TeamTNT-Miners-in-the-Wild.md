# TeamTNT Miners in the Wild

Last night Me and My friend were Looking for some Redis NOSQL (Because Most of them does not have any aunthetication ðŸ˜†) in Shodan and Censys for Bug Hunting.

I've found some interested which led me to write this blog post.

Most of the Redis seemed to be exploited and infected with a Miner by TeamTNT.

I used shodan query `port:6379` to find Redis services.

Redis has a tool called `redis-cli` which let you interact with Redis servers.
I used it to connect Redis servers to find vulnerabilities and sensitive data for bug hunting report.
To connect a Redis server you can use `redis-cli -h [Redis Server IP]`.

Redis is a Key-Value NOSQL Database that store data in memory, We can find information about Redis state and OS with `info` command.
If you want to see just the Keyspace part (Information about Keys and DBs), Use `info Keyspace`.

It has a **db0** and **4 Key**. We can dump keys with `DUMP`, Also you can use `MGET` if `DUMP` didn't work.
