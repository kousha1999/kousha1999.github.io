## Extract PNG Malware from PCAP File

I want to talk about How I detected and extracted a PNG malware from a pcap file.
We will talk about:
- Introduction to Packet Analysis
- Introduction to Wireshark
- Detect Malicious Network Traffic
- Partial Content Responses
- Impact of Connection Problems
- Extract Malicious File from HTTP for analysis and Reverse Engineering

Nowadays cyber attacks have become more sophisticated. The use of malware is increasing, Malware comes in many forms such as:
- Trojan
- Worms
- Viruses
- etc.

Malware communicates with different domains and IP addresses for various reasons (e.g. Connect to [C&C](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server), Download the [Real Malware](https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/trojan-downloader.shtml), etc.). One of the steps of **Malware Analysis** is to examine these network connections.

We can analyse Malware network communications with different methods and tools, We can use some tools such as [FakeNet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fakenet) or [iNetSim](https://www.inetsim.org) to simulate and analyse outgoing connections, also we can analyse the captured network packets such as `.pcap` file, which can be analyse by [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org).

Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

_Wireshark Application_

Wireshark contains 3 window, top window (green background color) which call **Packet List**, the middle one is Packet Details window and bottom window is Packet Bytes.
- Packet List: Displays packets sent in a network interface.
- Packet Details: Displays the information and headers of a sent packet in details.
- Packet Bytes: This section displays the contents of a sent package in HEX and ASCII.

I want to analyse malicious network communication (for a malware) from PCAP file in this post. First we're going to open PCAP file (malware.pcap) in Wireshark, to do this, Select `File -> Open` from menu bar. (or simply use Ctrl + O shortcut key).

When you Open a PCAP file, depends on the system resources and PCAP size, it can takes seconds or minutes to open.

It seems there are lots of packets in PCAP file.

Select `Statistics -> Capture File Properties` from menu bar (Shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C`) to see some information about pcap file.

In the opened window, we can see how many packets captured and as already we guessed there is 931 packet.

Now we must make a list of endpoints in the captured packets. to do this just select `Statistics -> Endpoints` from menu bar.

Now we can see endpoints, easy right?!

What we have learned so far is that, there are so many endpoints and also we have 931 packets. Now we should determine what kind of connections do we have.
To do this select `Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy` from menu bar.
