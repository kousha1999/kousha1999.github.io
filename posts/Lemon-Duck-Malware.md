# Lemon Duck Malware or APT?!

A month ago I've got a Log from a company (we will call it victim corp from now) that it was detected as a malicios activity. What I've got from that report log was just an URL, Funny right?! :))

I've start to google dork it. After some search and googling I've found some URLs and one of them was from `app.any.run` website which is one of the best sandbox for malware analysis and downloading samples. It seems it's already analyzed. So i didn't stop and I wanted to analyze it myself.

I started collecting clues to figure out how to start my analysis. It seemed it started with some network communications so I started to look at them.
